						Very short summary of Albert Einstein
					</h2>

					<article class="article">
						<h3 class="article__title">Early life and education:</h3>
						<p class="article__para">
							Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[5] in the Kingdom of Württemberg
							in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular
							Ashkenazi Jews.[18][19] His parents were Hermann Einstein, a
							salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved
							to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded
							Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that
							manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.[5]

						<h3 class="article__title">Marriages and children</h3>
						<p class="article__para">
							Albert and Mileva Marić Einstein, 1912 Early correspondence
							between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987
							which revealed that the couple had a daughter named "Lieserl",
							born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her
							parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose
							real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein's letter
							in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for
							adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.[43][44]

						<h3 class="article__title">First scientific papers</h3>
						<p class="article__para">
							F In 1900, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den
							Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the Capillarity
							Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der
							Physik.[74][75] On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his
							thesis,[76] with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental
							Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor. As a result, Einstein was
							awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissertation A
							New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.[76][77]

						<h3 class="article__title">Death</h3>
						<p class="article__para">
							On 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by
							the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously
							been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[178] He took
							the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance
							commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him
							to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.[179] Einstein
							refused surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is
							tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it
							is time to go. I will do it elegantly."[180] He died in Princeton
							Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued
							to work until near the end.[181]
